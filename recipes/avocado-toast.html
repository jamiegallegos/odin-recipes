    <h1>Avocado Toast Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ah, avocado toast. A dish made with literally two relatively low-cost items you can buy at the store, yet
        a symbol for the luxurious and spoiled lifestyle of millenials of the world, meanwhile, a majority of
        the world's wealth continues to be hoarded and controlled by older generations. It's vegan, it's got fat,
        carbs, and some antioxidants! Plus, its <em>obviously</em> delicious, and for many, it's a classic staple of
        the depression snack repertroire.
        You already know how to make it, but this page exists for me to practice using HTML, so someday I, a millenial,
        can afford to have even MORE avocado toast.
    </h2>
