    <p>This dish does not overpromise. It doesn't claim to be authentic asian cuisine or particularly complex in
        flavor. What it does promise is tasty, quick, healthy, protein-packed satisfaction to get you through the day
        when all you can really do is the bare minimum. The tofu stir-fry doesn't ask much of us and that's why we
        love it.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Extra Firm Tofu</li>
